I am a PhD student in Mathematics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/), working under the supervision of [Professor Paul C Bressloff](https://bressloff.github.io/index.html). I started the PhD in 2024, having previously completed an MSc in Mathematics and a BSc in Applied Mathematics at [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)](https://www.fciencias.unam.mx/). My research focuses in stochastic models of cellular transport. I am currently researching resource accumulation in a target cell using search-and-capture processes with stochastic resetting and queuing theory.
