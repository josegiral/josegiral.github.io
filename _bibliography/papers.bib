  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of epidemiological phenomena associated to infectious diseases have long been modelled taking different approaches. However, recent pandemic events exposed many areas of opportunity to improve the existing models. We develop a stochastic model based on the idea that transitions between epidemiological stages are alike sampling processes that may involve more than one subset of the population or may be mostly dependent on time intervals defined by pathological or clinical criteria. We apply the model to simulate epidemics, analyse the final distribution of the case fatality ratio, and define a basic reproductive number to determine the existence of a probabilistic phase transition for the dynamics. The resulting modelling scheme is robust, easy to implement, and can readily lend itself for extensions aimed at answering questions that emerge from close examination of data trends, such as those emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, and other infectious diseases.}
